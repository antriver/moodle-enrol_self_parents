Self and parents enrolment method
===========
Based on Moodle's built in self enrolment plugin, this allows users to enrol theirself, or for their parents to enrol/unenrol them.

* When a child enrols, their parents also get enroled
* Parents can enrol their children
* Parents can unenrol their children
* A yes/no question can be asked when a parent enrols their child.

All of these can be turned on or off.


##### New fields in enrolment instances:
* customint8: Allow parents to enrol their children
* customchar1: Role for parents
* customchar2: Allow parents to unenrol their children
* customchar3: Parents count towards max enroled limit
